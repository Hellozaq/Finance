üß™ Testing
- Controller-level integration tests with @SpringBootTest and MockMvc
- Manual JWT generation using POST /auth/login
- Transaction tests without using @WithMockUser
- Custom DTO validation tests
- 25 test cases passed ‚úÖ

üß± Major Challenges Faced

1. JWT Token Validation Failure (MalformedJwtException)
   - Occurred due to mocking the wrong token format in tests.
   - Fixed by registering/logging in users in tests and extracting real tokens.

2. Validation Errors Not Returning 400
   - @Valid wasn't triggering due to missing @RequestBody or invalid input JSON structure.
   - Fixed by using JSON with empty strings and annotating controller DTO parameters correctly.

3. Cannot Resolve Symbol Errors
   - Multiple cases like Principal, WithMockUser, type() method, TransactionType enums, etc.
   - Solved by adding required imports or mocking security dependencies.

4. Mocking Failures in AuthControllerTest
   - Tried doNothing() on non-void methods like authenticate().
   - Fixed by switching to when(...).thenReturn(...) and using @SpringBootTest instead of @WebMvcTest.

5. Dependency Injection Issues with CustomUserDetailsService in Tests
   - Application failed to start due to missing bean in test context.
   - Fixed by avoiding test slicing (@WebMvcTest) and using full context via @SpringBootTest.

6. Mocking Principal for JWT Authenticated Users
   - Needed valid authentication context in integration tests instead of mocking users.
   - Used real registration + login requests to retrieve and pass actual tokens in headers.

7. ID Passed in JSON vs URL Confusion
   - Backend expected ID in JSON, not path param, for delete/update.
   - Tests were mistakenly using URL path variable.
   - Fixed by updating test payload to match controller contract.
